    <p>Hi! I usually go by the moniker Kognise on the internet. I&rsquo;m interested in a lot of stuff, and this website
      features some of it.

    <p>You&rsquo;re looking at its third or fourth iteration; this one is a lot more stripped down, but feels more like
      my actual personality than the &ldquo;product marketing page&rdquo; aesthetic that previous designs had.

    <p>I spend a significant portion of my time writing code and doing things with technology. I run a community of
      really awesome programmers which <a href='https://discord.com/invite/pwnsquad' target='_blank'
        rel='noopener noreferrer'>you should totally join</a>. I like building things for the fun of it, and as a result
      have a huge amount of side projects that I don&rsquo;t really know what to do with. I churn them out at such a
      crazy rate that there isn&rsquo;t really enough space for them here, but you can <a href='#projects'>click here to
        see an abridged list</a>.</p>

    <p>The languages/technologies I use on a daily basis and love are TypeScript, Rust, and Next.js. I daily drive NixOS
      with KDE Plasma, you can <a href='https://github.com/kognise/dotfiles/' target='_blank'
        rel='noopener noreferrer'>check out my dotfiles</a>. I design everything I make, and some things that I
      don&rsquo;t make, using Figma exclusively.</p>

    <p>Last summer I rode across the country with a bunch of other cool programmers on a literal freaking train with a
      full-on <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Dome_(railcar)' target='_blank'
        rel='noopener noreferrer'>superdome</a>, so that was pretty cool.</p>

    <p>9-year-old me making friends with a cool robot I made:</p>

    <h2 id='airplanes'>Airplanes!</h2>

    <p>I think aviation is pretty cool. I&rsquo;m currently learning to fly a good ol&rsquo; classic steam gauge Cessna
      172 for my Private Pilot License. I enjoy flying complex aircraft in flight simulators; I play Microsoft Flight
      Simulator in VR and sometimes FlightGear. I also love flying as a passenger when I have the chance.</p>

    <p>Here&rsquo;s some pictures I took while out:</p>

    <h2 id='music'>Music!</h2>

    <p>I&rsquo;m a very musical person. I&rsquo;ve played cello in classical, jazz, and new music styles for almost 11
      years. For a couple years I took piano lessons but I got a bit too busy to continue. Sometimes I compose music for
      acoustic instruments, and sometimes I create electronic bleep bloop sounds in a variety of styles using <a
        href='https://www.ableton.com/en/live/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Ableton</a>, <a
        href='https://www.reaper.fm/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>REAPER</a>, <a
        href='https://puredata.info/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Pd</a>, and <a
        href='https://cycling74.com/products/max/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Max</a>. Sometimes I even
      mix acoustic and electronic!</p>

    <p>I also listen to music for a large portion of my time awake. In fact, I&rsquo;m currently listening to <a
        href='#' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>song by artist</a>&mdash; this is live updated! I enjoy a lot
      of genres and artists, but I like upbeat and catchy things. I listen to a lot of hyperpop, various types of
      electronic dance music, and some rock. I also play some Beat Saber, although I haven't had enough time recently.

    <p>And as a bonus, see if you can spot 10-year-old me looking slightly confused at a concert:</p>

    <h2 id='other'>Other things &amp; where to find me!</h2>

    <p>I love learning new things, and I consider my top skill to be learning things quickly. I enjoy watching movies
      and reading lots of books absurdly quickly. I love a lot of anime-style films, including almost everything by
      Studio Ghibli as well as CoMix Wave; my favorite Ghibli film is probably <a
        href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087544/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>NausicaÃ¤ of the Valley of
        the Wind</a>. Some live-action movies I&rsquo;ve watched that stuck out to me are Lady Bird, Inception, and
      Don&rsquo;t Look Up. I&rsquo;m also a die-hard fan of the How to Train Your Dragon trilogy.</p>

    <p>Some of my favorite books:</p>
